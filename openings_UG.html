    <br>




    <hr><h6><b>Project #1: Machine learning for Seizure Prediction</h6></b>

    In Canada, approximately 1 in 100 people live with epilepsy, which amounts to nearly 300,000 Canadians. The condition affects individuals across all age groups, with 13% being children and youth (aged 1-19 years), 63% adults (aged 20-64 years), and 24% older adults (aged 65 and older). A primary symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which are uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that lead to changes in movement and consciousness. Detecting and predicting seizures in advance allows for medical interventions, such as real-time closed-loop electrical stimulation, which can significantly reduce symptoms and improve patients' quality of life.<br><br>

    Our team develops wearable devices for detecting and predicting seizures. Unlike conventional methods that require invasive EEG signal recording, our approach focuses on developing seizure prediction algorithms using surface EEG signals collected from wearable devices positioned behind the ears, allowing for comfortable long-term use. Through collaboration with clinicians, we have successfully recorded behind ear EEG data from several epileptic patients.<br><br>

    In this project, the student is expected to develop a machine learning model to predict the onset of seizures from the recorded behind ear EEG data. The design target is to achieve high sensitivity, a low false positive rate, and an accurate prediction window. <br><br>


    <b>Requirements:</b><br>
    - Knowledge and experience of machine learning<br>
    - Programming and data handling skills <br>
    - Domain specific knowledge in neurosience is NOT required<br>
    <br>





    <hr><h6><b>Project #2: Multi-channel Neural stimulator design in 180nm CMOS</h6></b>
    <p>Implantable neural interfacing technologies, especially electrical neural stimulators, are crucial for treating neurological disorders by directly modulating nerve activity, thereby restoring functions such as movement, sensation, and pain control in patients with conditions like Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and spinal cord injuries. These technologies offer targeted and adjustable interventions, enhancing patients' quality of life and enabling precise medical treatments that were previously unattainable. </p>  

    A primary concern in the design of invasive neural stimulators is safety, as residual charge can lead to tissue damage and electrode dissolution. Consequently, achieving charge balance is essential in electronic circuit design. The current mode stimulator is frequently utilized for this purpose. An ideal current mode stimulator can regulate the amount of charge irrespective of the load impedance. Such a stimulator requires a current source with high output impedance and precise current accuracy, ensuring minimal mismatches between channels.<br><br>

    In this project, the student is expected to design a neural stimulator using CMOS circuits with the 180nm PDK from TSMC. The student will engage in circuit design, simulation, layout, and post-layout verification, with the chip being taped out through the MPW service. <br><br>

    <b>Requirements:</b><br>
    - Knowledge of analog and digital electronics <br>
    - Experience in circuit design and layout <br>
    - Skills in using Cadence Virtuoso <br>
    <br>



            
    <hr><h6><b>Project #3: Real-time Wireless Brain-Machine Interfaces (Open Topic)</b></h6> 
    <p>Research in brain-machine interface (BMI) technology has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with the world, offering significant advancements in healthcare, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. Wearable BMIs can provide non-invasive, continuous monitoring and control, enabling real-time applications in prosthetics, rehabilitation, and assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities. Moreover, these advancements could lead to innovations in augmented reality, gaming, and communication, enhancing everyday life and expanding the possibilities of human-machine integration. The portability and ease of use of wearable BMIs make them a practical and scalable solution for widespread adoption.</p>    

    In this project, the student will be provided with a custom wireless EEG recording device developed in our lab. This EEG device streams recorded scalp EEG signals to a computer, where they are processed in a framework programmed in Python. The student is expected to propose a method to use the BMI device to control something in real time, such as robotics, electric model cars, or computer programs. To achieve this goal, the student will develop signal processing and machine learning models for real-time operation. The student is expected to collect data themselves for training the model and eventually demonstrate the system in real-time.<br><br>    

    
    <b>Requirements:</b><br>
    - Knowledge of signal processing and machine learning<br>
    - Skills in programming<br>

    <hr><h6><b>Project #4: Design of a Neural Stimulator with a High Compliance Voltage</b></h6>
    <p>Neural stimulator is a type of medical device that can be used for modulating neural activities and treating neurological disorders. Non-invasive neural stimulators are also used for neurorehabilitation after traumatic brain injuries or spinal cord injuries. The most commonly used type of electronic neural stimulator employs current-mode drivers. Current-mode stimulation can achieve high electronic charge precision independent of the load impedance, resulting in minimal tissue damage due to residual charges. In this project, we aim to develop a current-mode stimulator that supports a compliance voltage of +/-20V with programmable current amplitude, pulse width, and frequency. The current-mode stimulator driver will be built using off-the-shelf high voltage operational amplifiers. A Howland current source architecture will be used. A microcontroller (nRF5340) will be used for controlling the stimulator. </p>

		<hr><h6><b>Project #4: Design of a Portable Energy Harvesting Module</b></h6>
			<p>Advances in electronic designs significantly reduce the power consumption of electronics, which is especially important to extend the battery life of wearable devices, such as smart watches. In this project, we aim to develop a module that can harvest energy from the environment to power a wearable device, which can help reduce the battery recharging frequency and eventually may eliminate the batteries. The energy sources can be body motion, body temperature, radio frequency signal from the environment, or a combination of them. The design target is to provide 1~10mA power at a supply voltage of 3.3V. The design will be using off-the-shelf IC for energy harvesting.

		<hr><h6><b>Project #4: Design of an Ultra-Wideband Wireless Transceiver Module</b></h6>	
		<p>Recording brain signals from a large number of channels requires a high-speed wireless data link. Unfortunately, conventional wireless transceivers are either too slow (such as Bluetooth or Zigbee) or too power-hungry (such as Wifi). In this project, we aim to develop a low-power wireless module to achieve high-speed data transmission. We will be using a commercial Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Impulse Radio Transceiver Module, such as the SR1020 from Spark Microsystems (around 6GHz ~ 9.3GHz). https://www.sparkmicro.com/products/. By the end of this project, we aim to have a custom PCB that integrates the UWB chip with a SPI interface to an MCU. </p>
