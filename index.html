         <h4>Research Overview</h4>			
         <hr>
			
		<p>My current research focuses on developing ICs and systems with edge AI for advancing human health, 5G telecommunication, and environmental sciences. Specifically, I conduct interdisciplinary research in the following three themes: (1) biomedical IC designs for treating intractable neurological conditions; (2) ultra-wideband data converter designs for 5G telecommunication; and (3) multi-functional CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) sensor designs for environment monitoring. Currently, I conduct research at the University of Toronto (U of T) in collaboration with multiple faculty members in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering and the University Health Network (UHN), international researchers (e.g., the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, Tsinghua University in China), and industrial partners. </p>
			
		<p><strong>Theme 1: Neuroelectronic IC designs for human health.</strong> Up to 1 billion people around the world are suffering from neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Neurological disorders cost 25% of the global burden of diseases. There is a great need for improved treatments with low-cost and high efficacy, consuming mini-mum healthcare resources. My research develops neural implants, a type of medical device that can treat neurological conditions by providing therapeutic stimulation (similar to a heart pacemaker) to a patient in response to the real-time detection of irregular biomarkers in the neural signals (e.g., seizures). ICs have been developed for integrating neural implants into miniature chips for improving performance and reducing invasiveness. However, conventional ICs for neural implants have limited interfacing modalities and oversimplified neuromodulation algorithms. My research aims to overcome these limitations by advanced IC design techniques with edge AI. In addition, my research develops wearable, low-cost, autonomous medical devices for neu-rorehabilitation. 
			</p>
			
			
		<p><strong>Theme 2: Wideband Data Converters for 5G Telecommunication.</strong> 5G is a global wireless standard for the fifth generation telecommunication technologies, which deliver multi-Gbps mobile data speeds. 5G is projected to generate $4.36 trillion economic output and support 22 million jobs in 2030. 5G cell towers (i.e., base stations) are much cheaper, smaller, and lower power than earlier genera-tions, which can bring high-speed internet access to remote regions (e.g., Northern Canada) and underdeveloped countries that cannot afford the infrastructure of massive fiber-optic networks. Despite being more energy-efficient than earlier generations, massive deployments of 5G raise environmental concerns. Developing green and sustainable solutions (e.g., low-power IC, solar-powered bases stations, etc.) is a top-priority task, which needs top talents from both industry and academia. My research develops low-power IC techniques for reducing the power consumption for both mobile end and base station. For example, my research studies massive parallel path interleaving architecture for wideband data converters. 
					
			</p>			

		<p><strong>Theme 3: CMOS Sensors for Environmental Studies.</strong> According to WHO, 26% of the world’s population lack safely managed drinking water. Despite being one of the most water-rich nations in the world, Canada currently has been unable to test drinking water and identify toxins at low costs in the field to guarantee access to clean wa-ter, particularly for Indigenous peoples. My research will enable low-cost methods of real-time in-field monitoring of water contamination by developing miniature NMR spectrometers. The miniature NMR spectrometer features a fully integrated transceiver IC for on-chip signal proccessing. In addition, my research develops low-power, distributed multi-functional sensor nodes for environmental monitoring (e.g., ambient light, temperature, humidity, etc.). The sensor nodes have been integrated into responsive building facades for energy saving.

		<!--The human brain is among the most complex and mysterious objects in our known universe. It operates in a fascinating mechanism that we still know very little about. Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) is a technology that creates direct communication pathways between the brain and the external world, which opens the door for us to truly understand and learn from the brain. The field of BMI grows rapidly in recent years, and has shown thrilling advancements and applications in medicine, neuroscience, and engineering. </p>
			
		<p>My research develops electronic BMIs that not only read neural signals from the brain (neural decoding), but also write information back to the brains (neural encoding). Moreover, by integrating real-time signal processing and machine learning on-chip, the developed BMIs are capable of closed-loop neuromodulation and therapeutic intervention. Through close collaboration with neuroscientists, I was among the first to develop bidirectional BMIs for sensorimotor neuromodulation in freely behaving animal models. My work, the PennBMBI, has become a popular benchmark in this emerging area. With this advantageous BMI paradigm, we have successfully uncovered a number of neuroscience mechanisms in sensorimotor and cognitive processes. </p>			

		<p>A key contribution of my research lies in BMI design for sensory encoding. Although motor decoding and sensory encoding are equally important in nervous systems, BMI researches have been primarily focused on motor decoding. This is partially due to the lack of experimental paradigms and engineering tools in investigating sensory encoding. My research fills this important gap by introducing wireless sensor network and machine-learning based sensory modulation algorithms into the BMI system. With this new sensory-BMI paradigm, we successfully investigated encoding mechanisms in several animal models with encouraging outcomes. Our experiments, for the first time, show that animals not only can feel the artificially encoded sensory signals, but also can actively adjust the motor strategies to minimize the efforts in extracting the encoded information.
